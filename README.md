### Andrea Natania - PYTN-KS17-04

This repository is for my assignments and final projects for Hacktiv8 from Kampus Merdeka Independent Study program. </br>

## **Assignments:**
1. **First Assignment** (PYTN_Assgn_1_5_Andrea Natania.ipynb) : Data Visualization using Python (matplotlib, seaborn)
2. **Second Assignment** (PYTN_Assgn_2_5_Andrea Natania.ipynb) : Basic Data Cleaning,  Inference Statistics (mean, range, variance, probability distribution, hypothesis testing)
3. **Third Assignment** (PYTN_Assgn_3_5_Andrea_Natania.ipynb) : Data Modelling using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The code includes Exploratory Data Analysis, Label Encoding, Splitting Data and Scaling Data using scikit learn.

## **Final Projects:**
1. **First Fnal Project** (PYTN_KampusMerdeka_fp1_Andrea_Natania (PYTN_KampusMerdeka_fp1_Andrea_Natania (Kelompok 3)) : Modelling using Uber and Lyft dataset. The machine learning models used in this project are Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. This project includes comparing both model accuracy and deploying the model with highest accuracy to pickle.
2. **Second Final Project** (PYTN_KampusMerdeka_fp2_Kelompok3) : The dataset used in this project is weather data in Australia to predict weather. The machine learning models used in this project are Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. This project includes comparing both model accuracy and deploying the model with highest accuracy to pickle.
3. **Third Final Project** (PYTN_KampusMerdeka_fp3_Kelompok3) : The dataset used in this project is patient data with heart failures to predict death with heart failure as the cause. The machine learning model used in this project are Random Forest Model. In this project, we compare the Random Forest Classifier model with and without hyperparameter tuning, and deployed the model with highest accuracy to pickle
